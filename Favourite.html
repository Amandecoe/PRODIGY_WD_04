        <p>Watching Movies is one of those activities that you can do for fun but also binge and regret it later, finding that sweet spot for that have been a little
            hard for myself lately.
            Here are some of my favorite movies i have watched, this list is entirely personal and based on my taste only, but I do believe no one can hate these
            movies if they can immerse themselves in it.

        <h3>Crime and Punishment</h3>
        <h4>Fyodor Dostovesky</h4>
        <p>Crime and Punishment is a profound psychological study of Rodion Raskolnikov, a destitute student in St. Petersburg who murders an elderly pawnbroker to prove his
            "Great Man" theory—the belief that superior individuals are entitled to transcend moral laws to achieve higher goals. However, instead of becoming a powerful benefactor,
            he is immediately consumed by debilitating guilt, paranoia, and social alienation. The narrative follows his agonizing mental breakdown and his intellectual sparring with the
            cunning investigator Porfiry Petrovich, eventually culminating in his spiritual confession and path toward redemption. Through this struggle, Dostoevsky critiques 19th-century
             nihilism, arguing that true peace and morality cannot be found through cold logic, but only through the acceptance of suffering and human connection.

        <h4>Dr.Alemayehu Wassie Eshete</h4>
        <p>
            Merbebt (መርበብት) is a thought-provoking Amharic novel published in 2010 by the renowned forest ecologist Dr. Alemayehu Wassie Eshete. Part of a literary series that includes
             Emegua and Zgora, the book delves into complex historical and philosophical discussions that bridge the author's scientific background in natural sciences with deep explorations
             of Ethiopian identity, culture, and spirituality. Through its narrative, Merbebt encourages intellectual discourse on preserving moral values and cultural heritage, reflecting
             Dr. Alemayehu's broader mission to foster a society built on integrity and wisdom rather than division.

      <h3>BBQ Burger</h3>
      <p>A barbecue burger is a flavorful twist on the classic hamburger that centers on a smoky, tangy, or sweet flavor profile achieved through specific ingredients and cooking techniques.
         The defining element is typically a rich barbecue sauce, which can be glazed over the patty or mixed into the ground beef—ideally an 80/20 blend for maximum juiciness. These burgers
         are often piled high with "smokehouse" toppings such as crispy bacon, sharp cheddar cheese, and fried onion rings to add texture and depth. While most are seared quickly over
         a charcoal or gas grill to create a charred crust, true barbecue enthusiasts may slow-smoke the patties with wood chunks to deeply infuse them with authentic pit-cooked flavor.

        <h3>Kitfo</h3>
        <p>Kitfo is a prized Ethiopian delicacy consisting of finely minced raw beef marinated in niter kibbeh (a herbed, clarified butter) and mitmita (a fiery chili-based spice blend). Originating
             from the Gurage people, this "Ethiopian steak tartare" is traditionally served completely raw, though it can be ordered lightly seared as leb leb for those who prefer a touch of heat.
              It is typically presented on a communal platter with ayib (mild cottage cheese) and gomen (collard greens) to balance the spice, and eaten using kocho or injera flatbread as a utensil.

         with spicy berbere, it can be served "dry" (seared until crispy) or "wet" (in a rich sauce), and is traditionally eaten by hand using injera flatbread.
