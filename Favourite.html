            <h4 id = "Dir">Directed by Joel Coen, Ethan Coen</h4>
            <img class = "NoCountryImg" src = "./assets/No Country for Old Me Background Removed.png" >
            <p id = "oldmanp">
              Directed by the Coen Brothers and adapted from Cormac McCarthy’s stark novel, No Country for Old Men is a haunting neo-Western that strips away the romanticism of the American frontier
              to reveal a world governed by chaos and chance. The narrative is set in motion when Llewelyn Moss, a resourceful but overconfident hunter, stumbles upon a botched drug deal in the Texas desert.
               By choosing to take a suitcase filled with two million dollars, Moss inadvertently triggers a relentless pursuit that transcends a simple game of cat-and-mouse, becoming instead a
               meditation on the nature of destiny and the inevitability of decay. <br>
              Central to the film’s atmospheric dread is Anton Chigurh, a hitman who functions less like a person and more like an elemental force of nature. Chigurh is the personification of a new, senseless brand of violence;
              he often decides the lives of his victims with the toss of a coin, suggesting that in a godless universe, survival is merely a matter of cold, hard probability. He is the "unstoppable force" to Moss’s
              "movable object," and their collision course provides the film with its gripping, high-stakes tension.<br>
              While the action is visceral, the soul of the movie lies with Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. As a veteran lawman, Bell represents the moral order of a bygone era—a time when he believed he could understand and combat evil.
               However, as he tracks Chigurh’s wake of destruction, Bell is forced to confront his own obsolescence. The film’s refusal to provide a traditional Hollywood climax—most notably by having its protagonist perish
               off-screen—denies the audience any easy catharsis. Instead, it concludes on a somber, reflective note, leaving us to contemplate Bell’s realization that the world has become a place where the old rules no longer
               apply and where "the path of the righteous" is increasingly difficult to find.<br>

        <h3>Crime and Punishment</h3>
        <h4>Fyodor Dostovesky</h4>
        <p>Crime and Punishment is a profound psychological study of Rodion Raskolnikov, a destitute student in St. Petersburg who murders an elderly pawnbroker to prove his
            "Great Man" theory—the belief that superior individuals are entitled to transcend moral laws to achieve higher goals. However, instead of becoming a powerful benefactor,
            he is immediately consumed by debilitating guilt, paranoia, and social alienation. The narrative follows his agonizing mental breakdown and his intellectual sparring with the
            cunning investigator Porfiry Petrovich, eventually culminating in his spiritual confession and path toward redemption. Through this struggle, Dostoevsky critiques 19th-century
             nihilism, arguing that true peace and morality cannot be found through cold logic, but only through the acceptance of suffering and human connection.

        <h4>Dr.Alemayehu Wassie Eshete</h4>
        <p>
            Merbebt (መርበብት) is a thought-provoking Amharic novel published in 2010 by the renowned forest ecologist Dr. Alemayehu Wassie Eshete. Part of a literary series that includes
             Emegua and Zgora, the book delves into complex historical and philosophical discussions that bridge the author's scientific background in natural sciences with deep explorations
             of Ethiopian identity, culture, and spirituality. Through its narrative, Merbebt encourages intellectual discourse on preserving moral values and cultural heritage, reflecting
             Dr. Alemayehu's broader mission to foster a society built on integrity and wisdom rather than division.

      <h3>BBQ Burger</h3>
      <p>A barbecue burger is a flavorful twist on the classic hamburger that centers on a smoky, tangy, or sweet flavor profile achieved through specific ingredients and cooking techniques.
         The defining element is typically a rich barbecue sauce, which can be glazed over the patty or mixed into the ground beef—ideally an 80/20 blend for maximum juiciness. These burgers
         are often piled high with "smokehouse" toppings such as crispy bacon, sharp cheddar cheese, and fried onion rings to add texture and depth. While most are seared quickly over
         a charcoal or gas grill to create a charred crust, true barbecue enthusiasts may slow-smoke the patties with wood chunks to deeply infuse them with authentic pit-cooked flavor.

        <h3>Kitfo</h3>
        <p>Kitfo is a prized Ethiopian delicacy consisting of finely minced raw beef marinated in niter kibbeh (a herbed, clarified butter) and mitmita (a fiery chili-based spice blend). Originating
             from the Gurage people, this "Ethiopian steak tartare" is traditionally served completely raw, though it can be ordered lightly seared as leb leb for those who prefer a touch of heat.
              It is typically presented on a communal platter with ayib (mild cottage cheese) and gomen (collard greens) to balance the spice, and eaten using kocho or injera flatbread as a utensil.
