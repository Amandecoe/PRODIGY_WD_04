       <h4>Gym</h4>
       <p>Staying active is my way of staying energized. From heavy lifting sessions to functional training, I love pushing my physical limits and seeing what the human body is capable of.
         It’s not just about the aesthetics; it’s about having the strength and stamina to enjoy everything else life has to throw at me.

      <p>
        To me, cinema is more than just entertainment—it’s an empathy machine. I find myself drawn to stories that challenge my perspective, whether it’s a beautifully shot A24 drama, a timeless Noir classic, or a foreign-language
         masterpiece. I’m a firm believer that some of life’s best lessons are learned in the dark of a movie theater

     <div class = "Football">
      <h3 id = "Footballemoji">⚽</h3>
      <h4>Football</h4>
      <p>Football is the universal language. I’ve always been drawn to the energy of the stands and the way a single goal can unite a city. Whether I’m following my club through the highs and lows or watching a neutral masterpiece,
        I love the storytelling and the raw passion that only the 'beautiful game' can provide.</p>
